In **local mode** where the app is run locally on a PC (e.g. via Windows executable) the user can create and delete separate workspaces for different projects.

This app serves both as documentation and showcase what's possible with OpenMS web apps. 
            
In general there are two options for building workflows.
            
### 1. üöÄ **TOPP Workflow Framework**
            
Use this option if you want a standardized framework for building your workflow.

- **Pre-defined user interface** all in one streamlit page with all steps on different pages:
    - **File Upload**: upload, download and delete input files
    - **Configure**: Automatically display input widgets for all paramters in TOPP tools and custom Python scripts
    - **Run**: Start and stop workflow execution, includes continous log
    - **Results**: Interactive result dashboard
- **Write less code**: everything from file upload, input widget generation and execution of tools is handled via convenient functions
- **Fast and performant workflows**: Automatic parallel execution of TOPP tools ensures great speed, comparable with workflows written in bash
- **Ideal for longer workflows**: Close the app and come back to the still running or finish workflow the next day, by entering your workspace again.

### 2. üêç **Flexible, custom workflow with pyOpenMS on multiple pages**
            
Use this option if you want full control over your workflow implementation and user interface.

Uses the integrated parameter handling with global parameters across pages, including uploaded files.
            
To get an idea check out the following pages from the example worklfow (file upload first!).
