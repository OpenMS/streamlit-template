This package contains Python bindings for a large part of the OpenMS library
for mass spectrometry based proteomics.  It thus provides providing facile
access to a feature-rich, open-source algorithm library for mass-spectrometry
based proteomics analysis. These Python bindings allow raw access to the
data-structures and algorithms implemented in OpenMS, specifically those for
file access (mzXML, mzML, TraML, mzIdentML among others), basic signal
processing (smoothing, filtering, de-isotoping and peak-picking) and complex
data analysis (including label-free, SILAC, iTRAQ and SWATH analysis tools).

You can install pyopenms using::

  pip install pyopenms
